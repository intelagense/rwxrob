job: &job >-
  💰🏦🌐 I work from !home for TEKSystems (!tek) as a full-time
  Kubernetes (!k8s) cloud native infrastructure engineer and software
  developer (!dev) for a well-paying multinational corporation (!dox)
  supporting thousands of high performance machine learning compute
  nodes. !findjob

work: *job

remote: &remote >-
  💻📞 I've been working 100% remote since 2000. I was hired as fully
  remote by !IBM after I was head-hunted by a recruiter out of !Nike.
  Working remotely requires strong separation of your work environment
  from your living space, usually. After 20 years I'm okay mixing the
  two. Most can't. I plan on !coworking from the road and !IRL !twitch
  streaming in 2022 at some point.

home: *remote

jobs: &jobs >-
  💰💪🧠 According to US Bureau of Labor and Statistics and job boards
  (like Indeed) the Fastest growing jobs (not just in tech) are 1)
  security analyst, 2) cloud-native infrastructure engineer, and 3)
  software developer. All of them have starting salaries well over $100k
  and all require !linux and !coding skills that we go over during
  !boost. !findjob

dev: &dev >-
  💻 I prefer "software developer" or "coder" over "engineer" (which is
  illegal to call yourself in Canada without specific schooling). I've
  written thousands of lines of code a dozen or so different languages
  running on millions of systems including most of the Fortune 100.
  While computer science has its place, my work has always been
  practical.

coder: *dev

tek: >-
  🤝 TEKSystems is one of the largest recruiting tech contract work
  companies. You work for TEK, but TEK equally works for you. Unlike
  other companies, you are their customer and their product. You'll make
  20-40% less, but they are financially motivated to have your back,
  keep you happy, and find your next gig. The independence is worth it.

vi: &vi >-
  😎 https://rwx.gg/visurvive Vi/m make me productive quickly on *any*
  UNIX-like (!unix) system and leverages the full power of !UNIX
  !filters over bloated, non-portable plugins. I build my filters into
  my !go !Bonzai command tree that I can take anywhere with me and use
  for scripting as well. (See !ed !neovim !emacs !vscode

vim: *vi

editor: *vi

editors: *vi

ed: >-
  💻 Ed is the "standard editor" and although people joke about it, it
  is worth using. Every time you use : in vi/m you are using ex (the newer
  version of ed). Every time you use sed you are using ed. Ed leverages
  the !UNIX !filter philosophy to the fullest. !editor

emacs: >-
  💻 emacs is a fine editor if you use the same system to do your
  editing. It's a horrible editor if you want to edit files on multiple,
  different UNIX systems without installing anything. You also cannot
  use emacs to certify in anything. I prefer !vim with very few plugins
  (as do most hackers and ops people).

vscode: >-
  💻 vscode (from Microsoft) is an my favorite graphical editor, but
  I prefer a universal terminal editor like !vim which can do things
  VSCode users can't even dream of by implementing the !UNIX shell into
  the development process by using !filters over plugins.

unix: >-
  💻 Way before there was !linux, UNIX existed. The UNIX philosophy is
  the reason UNIX beat every other serious operating system. Not many
  people know that Apple macOS is the largest UNIX distro in the world.
  "Do one thing well, and make it integrate" is the UNIX philosophy.
  UNIX !filters are the most powerful, functional approach to the
  terminal and !editor.

filter: &filter >-
  💻 A !UNIX filter is a functional approach to command line piping of
  the output of one command into input of another. Using this method any
  program, small script or large application, can integrate seamlessly
  with everything else. The !vim "filter" command is an exclamation mark
  (!). It is the single most powerful command in all of !vim. Learn it!
  https://rwx.gg/vimagic

filters: *filter

neovim: &neovim >-
  💩 Neovim is shit. Mostly because it has no fucking clue what the
  !UNIX philosophy is about or for. Don't ruin yourself by learning it.
  Learn !vim and how to !filter properly.

primedrama: >-
  😟 Yes, I've had drama with him when he very publicly attacked me on
  Twitter (later YouTube) because he thought a zet I wrote was about him
  (even though there were no names). The zet was about how grateful I am
  for the quality of my community (compared to others generally).
  I deleted it after trolling PR attacks from him and his followers on
  my zet repo. !primeagen

  I suggest seeking out more experienced mentors (not just me) who are
  usually a lot harder to find than him. @learnwithleon is a good one.

school: >-
    🏫 I graduated Brigham Young University (BYU) with Russian Language
    degree, partial Honors, and just shy of a minor in French and
    Computers and Linguistics. I was there >6 years, worked 3 jobs
    concurrently: language lab, French/Russian instructor, bike shop
    mechanic, language/culture instructor and Resident Assistant at
    Mormon Missionary Training Center.

foss: &foss >-
  🐧 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) powers the world these days.
  The device you are using right now likely contains significant work
  from FOSS contributors --- especially !Apple computers, which are
  entirely built on "darwin" !BSD !UNIX.

opensource: *foss

creed: &creed >-
  😊 Here's my personal creed (which I regularly fail to keep).  My
  main life mantra is "don't get mad, get busy" (because I get mad all
  the fucking time). I guess it is my version of "be the change you want
  to seen in the world". But, I have no problem calling out morons and
  people saying stupid shit. Sorry.
  https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/tree/main/20210502120622

mad: *creed
sad: *creed
mean: *creed


faang: >-
  💩 FAANG is shit. It means nothing. Hell, Microsoft (!ms) isn't even
  included that's how fucking stupid the term is. People who willfully
  use it are morons. Facebook (!fb) doesn't belong, at all. MANGA is cooler,
  but still, look for more than these companies, so many companies are
  BETTER on most every objective level.

mute: &mute >-
  🙊 Mute just means I'm not using my microphone usually because I'm
  focused (!focused) and working on something and speaking breaks the
  flow (!flow). Occasionally, I'll break the silence (when raided to say
  hello, for example).

voice: *mute
talking: *mute

facebook: &facebook >-
  💩 Facebook got famous ranking women's faces against one another
  without their consent. It deliberately promoted illegal use to
  children under 12 ("whales") using their parents credit cards. It
  hires experts in neurological addiction and deliberately incites
  violence for money. It's  popular with hate mongers and manipulators
  (like Putin) to blow up civil society, divide families, and bring us
  to war. If you use it YOU are a part of the problem. I don't.

fb: *facebook

music: &music >-
  🎧 https://www.last.fm/user/rwxrob and !song for music. Want something
  added to the playlist? Just find a link to the song on Spotify and
  post it in chat. Happy to take requests.  I have HackerYoga,
  BeachConcert, FolkGrass, 90sChicks, Industrial, Chillhop,
  Synthwave, CoffeeHouse and Piano Jazz. I don't really listen to more
  than that on stream.

playlist: *music

flow: >-
  🤔 Getting in the !flow is something that got popular with techie Cal
  Newport's completely unscientific (but probably correct) book 'Deep
  Work'. Breaking someone's flow is a cardinal sin at most tech shops.
  Keeping a flow is nearly impossible on Twitch, nearly. Using pomodoro
  helps (!pomo).

pomo: &pomo >-
   🍅 ding dong, time to take a 12 pomo break! ❓ Pomodoro method means
   focusing on something intensely then taking a regular break.  Our
   sessions are 54 minutes long since Twitch gives us free,
   uninterrupted time if we take a 12 minute break. Nobody wants an add
   to interrupt them during their flow, right? (!flow) Read more at
   https://github.com/rwxrob/pomo, or add to your own Bonzai tree (!bonzai)

bonzai: &bonzai >-
  🌳 https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai Bonzai™ is a unique command
  compositor with recursive tab completion that I create to replace
  !shell scripts with a single, portable !go multicall, command tree
  binary that I can curl onto anything. I use it for everything (!z).
  Want to learn  to make your own?  Be sure to catch the Beginner Boost
  on May 4th (!boost).

bon: >-
  🌳 https://github.com/rwxrob/bon is a !bonzai utility to help with
  development, use, distribution, and discovery of Bonzai™ commands.
  Eventually, it will be able to cache and search through all Bonzai
  tree descriptions and summaries. Use it to initialize a new branch and
  compile and create new standalone releases.

z: >-
  🌳 https://github.com/rwxrob/z is my !bonzai composite command tree,
  something I invented. I'm migrating my !bash and !perl !shell scripts
  to it so I have a portable, single collection of commands I can use
  anywhere. Plus because !go, my code is useable in other !work and
  !foss projects so I'm not wasting time porting.

boost: &boost >-
  ⚡ https://github.com/rwxrob/boost The SKILSTAK Beginner Boost™ is an
  annual free, live, recorded, tech series focused on helping people get
  security and IT operations jobs. We start Wednesday May the 4th at
  11:11:11 and have weekly live five-hour sessions most every Saturday
  with AMA on Sundays recorded to Youtube. See GitHub for prereqs,
  outline, and previous Boosts.

musician: >-
  🎼 I've loved music my whole life but never been good enough to make
  money at it. I was a Madrigal in high-school and in percussion
  emsemble. I learned guitar in college to get chicks. It worked. I did
  open mics in Second Life and later in real life, mostly Jack Johnson
  and beach stuff.

focus: &focus >-
  🤔🎧 I'm focused right now to stay in the flow (!flow). Best way to
  communicate is send a chat message that I'll maybe eventually read --
  especially if you have a Q at the beginning. Catch me on my break
  (!pomo). I might talk then. Please chat away though, others here might
  be able to answer your questions. Also look up the !commands.

focused: *focus

search: &search >-
  ❓ I search from the command line using three commands 'duck' (?) or
  'google' (??) or 'bing' (???) which open the results in my highly
  customized lynx (!lynx) browser. This means my command line history
  becomes my search history, which I search using Vim mode ('set -o
  vi').

lynx: &lynx >-
  😼 Lynx (the text-based web browser) in vi mode is the fastest way to
  do web research. I pity graphic web browser users --- especailly
  hackers --- who haven't learned it. Need a graphic browser?  Just hit
  comma (,) to open it. There's no tracking and text is consistent so
  your eyes remain focused and able to scan at maximum speed. Watch me
  if you're not convinced. Start with w3m if Lynx is too much at first.

fish: &fish >-
  🐟 The fishies are the ancient !Perl asciiquarium script that has been
  modified (by @qmacro) to have !rwx on one of the fish and uses
  transparent background (instead of black). You can get a copy under
  "scripts" in my !dot files.

dot: >-
  💥 https://github.com/rwxrob/dot Here are my "dotfiles" (which are
  named that because configuration files on !UNIX and !Linux usually
  start with a dot in your home directory.) I include a bunch of scripts
  in there as well even though I am moving most of them into my !z
  !bonzai tree.

help: >-
  😃 I'm happy to help when and if I can, but often I just can't. I like
  to help people help themselves. If you haven't even done miminal
  research expect to be mocked. Ask a question with Q and someone will
  maybe help you out. Try !discord as well. If you are asking us to do
  your homework or hack someone, forget it.

name: &name >-
  🔒 The 'rwx' in my name means 'read, write, execute' and refers to the
  UNIX/Linux permissions on any file or directory. But RWX is also
  a personal recipe for learning and success: 'read, research', 'write
  it', and 'experiment, explore, experience, exchange'. There's no better
  learning methodology, grounded in pragmatism. !boost !read !comm !publish

rwx: *name

read: &read >-
  📖👓☕ Everyone should be reading at least two hours a day,
  technologists will be reading about six hours. Research is active
  reading when you do things while reading. !lynx is by far the fastest
  way to do effective !Web research. Watch me and make your own decision.
  Reading is a major part of the !RWX method.

research: *read

nature: &nature >-
  🌄😃🌲🌊 Nature is my temple, and running my communion. There's
  nothing that centers me more than being under the open sky, the same
  sky we all share. It's not just about being one with nature, it's
  about being one with everyone in it, realizing we are fundamentally
  the same. I need that reminder constantly. Go outside.  Right now.
  You'll be glad you did.

outside: *nature
running: *nature

irl: >-
    💚 You have permission to have a life, a real life. You don't need
    anyone to give that to you. Seize the day. Do something "in real
    life" that one day you won't be able to. Do one thing every day that
    scares you. Keep it real. I try to do this myself, to get !outside
    and do more than just sit at my desk.

beej: >-
  📕 http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ Beej's Guide to Network Programming is
  one of the best resources any developer should ever read. It covers
  things that are not intuitive to beginners like proper UNIX file locking.

started: >-
  🐣👶 I started !coding at 11 on the only Atari 400 at school coding
  BASIC making !dnd character generation programs I dropped coding for most of
  my teen years and picked up again in my 20s in college where I taught
  myself HTML from by reading RFCS (!rfc) and learned Pascal before changing
  majors from CS to !Russian.

dnd: >-
  🐉 I played tons of Dungeons and Dragons. I credit it for a lot of
  what I've been able to do since. It helps with problem-solving and
  creativity. I created huge campaigns and hoped to work for TSR one
  day. I had hundreds of hand-painted figures and did some of my own art
  for the game. I was obsessed with Boris Vallejo and Dungeon Magazine
  (I was really hornt).

russian: >-
  The Cold War ended while I was in college and I majored in Russian.
  I was a cruise director and tour guide in Moscow, St.  Petersburg, and
  Ukraine and made deep friendships (and enemies) while there. I have
  *many* stories including traveling with an arms dealer on the train,
  translating for mob bosses, and being body guard to Samatha Fox.
  I deeply love the Russian people.

french: >-
  I served a !Mormon mission to the French West Indies and upon my
  return taught French at !school where I also was a few credit hours
  shy of a Minor. I deeply love French and Caribbean culture and have
  grown an affinity for French Canadians as well. Twitch is a phenomenal
  place for language training. OMG, it's just amazing. Changed my major
  to !Russian later though.

skilstak: >-
    💥⚡ https://skilstak.io (but very out of date) I started SKILSTAK
    Coding Arts in 2013 with my own retirement money to try and do
    something about no one teaching Linux and coding to kids from an
    early age. It grew pretty big over the next eight years but life and
    Covid eventually pushed me to take a full-time job again and move
    SKILSTAK to Twitch and YouTube.

rfc: >-
  📗 An IETF RFC is what specifies how the Internet works. Reading them
  can be very illuminating.

go: &go >-
  💻💨 https://github.com/rwxrob/awesome-go Go is the best general
  purpose modern language. You can do shit quickly and safely. Docker,
  Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm, all written in Go. Designed by tech-gods
  Thompson/Pike/Griesemer (also UNIX, C, Unicode) it meets the real
  needs of Google and major enterprises. It was specifically designed to
  replace Java/Python/C/C++.

golang: *go

coding: &coding >-
  💢 You can find current coding lang in brackets at the bottom of the
  screen. The term "coding" includes things that most people do not
  consider to be "programming". It's more colloquial. I've coded in more
  than a dozen languages (!codelangs) at this point. Coding is
  a fundamental part of *any* tech job. Don't let anyone tell you
  differently. (See also !project !started.)

programming: *coding

  makefile awk python peg !pegn hcl rego html css sql javascript ruby
  abnf ebnf typescript deno coffeescript toml ini c cpp csharp graphql
  uml pug stylus php java actionscript hypercard lsl haskel basic.
  I want to learn erlang and lisp and hate !rust.

zig: >-
  🤷 People like Zig. It's intriguing, but will never be significant.
  I found using *any* identifier variation (underscores, hyphens,
  dashes, mixed case) a particularly cool (and at the same time stupid)
  design decision. Wasted compile time is a silly over site. People
  never think about code in the millions of lines. Zig would crash and
  burn.

anton: >-
  💻 Yes, "anton" is a Silicon Valley (!sv) reference. !gilfoyle

sv: &sv >-
  📺 Silicon Valley is one of my favorite shows out there. It satirizes
  Silicon Valley in a way that makes me cry laughing. The show it full
  of Easter eggs for those looking. !Gilfoyle is one of my favorite
  characters of all time.

gilfoyle: >-
  😎 Gilfoyle is from the Silicon Valley (!sv) show. Watch the "what the
  fuck do I do" YouTube video about Gilfoyle. It's perfect.  I aspire to
  be a !Gilfoyle and named my VM !anton in his memory. I love the
  Gilfoyle (ops) vs Dinesh (apps) dynamic which mirrors my experience
  working in both sides of tech.

siliconvalley: *sv

sleep: >-
  🥱💤 I do sleep. I promise. I refuse to work when I'm sleepy. I've
  made too many critical errors in the past from lack of sleep.
  Generally, I sleep from 7pm to 2:30am. My body naturally wants almost
  exactly 7.5 hours of sleep every time. !schedule

theme: &theme >-
  💻 I use a slightly darkened version of GruvBox on a 81x25, Microsoft
  Terminal (1920x1080 screen) from which I ssh into "anton" (my local
  Ubuntu Server vm in VirtualBox named in honor of Gilfoyle) and run
  nested TMUX. Font is 28p Ubuntu Mono with wrap set to 72 column.
  I used to do transparent background for streaming but it was murder on
  my eyes.

  💻 Learn to use the !linux !bash terminal (!tui). It's objectively the
  most powerful and efficient interface for most human-computer

  you learn it compared to others. This requires learning !vim !tmux and
  !lynx to be the most effective.

    😊 Life is about meeting people. You might not like it, but them are
    the facts. You need to meet to people to !findjob, to love, and from
    whom you can learn while !coworking. So get to meeting people.
    Twitch is a great place, so is https://meetup.com. Then there's
    Tinder (if you're into that sort of thing). I met !doris on
    https://pof.com. (I'm not proud, oh the stories).

comm: &comm >-
  💬 Communication is the most important skill no one talks about, the
  W in RWX, learning how write, to present yourself, your ideas, your
  concerns in multiple languages, to people from multiple cultures and
  backgrounds. Good communicators dominate everything they do (including
  social engineering, if you are into that sort of thing). Learn it.

communicate: *comm
communication: *comm

publish: >-
    💻📃📖 Publish what you do. It's not hard. It's a core part of the
    !RWX process. It also makes the world a better place. Everyone can
    do it. Even if just learning. Share how you learned it. Some else
    will relate. Learn !Web !dev enough to make your own free site. Get
    on !KEG and maintain a !zet.

  🕐 Right now its {time.America/New_York} in Mooresville, North
  Carolina, US Eastern time zone, same as New York. The date and time
  and time left until the boost are almost always on the bottom of the
  screen. Also see !about !schedule !sleep.

walktalk: >-
    ⛅🚶🌄 Nothing like going outside to do our random talking about
    tech, art, music, and just life. This is the time to ask completely
    random questions, to get me to tell you stories, and watch me crash
    on my skateboard. (Sometimes I run or skate or bike instead of
    walk.)

  ❗ https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/blob/main/twitch/commands.yaml If
  you see a command I'm missing (or a typo) go ahead and make a PR (if
  you like). Eventually, I hope to render this file as a single,
  relative-hyperlinked web page so people can navigate it without
  Twitch.

cmds: *commands

shell: &shell >-
  💻 I live on the !bash Linux shell (as do most hackers and
  infrastructure engineers, !work). A "shell" is technically any program
  that interfaces with a user to pass on commands to the
  operating system. Most shells use a !repl

bash: >-
  💻 bash is the default Linux !shell and the most powerful shell
  currently in existence. I'm on bash 5+. It's in my top five favorite
  !codelangs of all time. It's `complete -C` is mandatory for any
  reasonable modern tab completion (!bonzai). BTW, Make sure to use
  !shellcheck when writing *any* shell script and !RTFM if you want to
  learn it.

repl: &repl >-
  💻 "Read, evaluate/execute, print loop" is a method of user interaction
  with a program. Also sometimes called a "command line interface" and
  (mistakenly) called a "terminal interface" (!tui). Steps: 0) app prompts
  user for input, 1) user enters input, 2) app reads input 3), app does
  something 4) repeat. !bash is a REPL. https://repl.it is a service that
  focuses on this.

cli: *repl

tui: >-
  💻 A "terminal user interface" is when a user interacts with the
  text-only terminal where the screen is divided up into cells of
  columns and lines. Emojis are usually supported, but no other
  graphics. TUI apps may be !CLI, but not necessarily. Sometimes arrow
  or other keys are used to navigate, like !vi or !tmux or !lynx.

rtfm: &rtfm >-
  😎📖 READ THE FUCKING MANUAL! (man man) This is the best way to get
  solid answers for !UNIX and !Linux and the *only* way to truly learn
  !bash. NOT doing this is one thing that distinguishes !hackers from
  normies. Hackers read shit: Whitepapers, !RFCs, man pages, source code
  for fun. These are your bibles. Learn to love them. And stop reading
  Reddit and Dev.to.

man: *rtfm

shellcheck: >-
  💻 https://www.shellcheck.net is a critical tool that should be used
  on *every* !shell script every written. Shell scripts are notoriously
  buggy and unsafe. This is the only way to be 100% sure you are okay.
  Plus there is an exhaustive wiki with descriptions of all the
  potential errors.

zsh: >-
  💩 zsh is the default !shell on Mac cuz Apple steals from !FOSS, not
  because it's better.  Zsh is, in fact, inferior to !bash and
  dangerously encouraging floating point math which is NOT !POSIX.
  !Bonzai completion fails on zsh because zsh does not support minimal
  `complete -C` completion. People just don't know better I guess. I do.


zet: &zet >-
  📃 https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/README.md  My
  "zettelkasten" repo where I brain dump everything with little
  attention to grammar, spelling, and political correctness. You've been
  warned. Eventually, this will become a part of my !KEG node.

zetplan: >-
    📃 Planning to port !zet from !bash to !go this year. It will be one
    of the !bonzai branches being grafted into Mimir (!mim)

mim: >-
    💡 Mimir is a comprehensive knowledge management suite of
    applications I'm slowly creating focused specifically on personal
    learning, mentoring, and live community building. Eventually, mim will
    contain related !go !bonzai branches: !keg, kn, web, dl, live, twitch,
    yt, twitter, project, todo, pomo, cv, agent. Mim will leverage CLI and
    local WebUI. !edtech !iste

edtech: >-
    🏫🧠💻 I love educational technology and Instructional Technology
    Specialists. I believe tech's primary purpose should be reduction of
    human suffering and improvement to quality of life and knowledge.
    Learning is at the core of that. I've presented at !ISTE, given
    workshops, and even run Second Life (!sl) EDTECH Retreat for several
    years. !mim

    a real difference in education. I was an !sl docent for ISTE and
    have presented, etc. One day I'll present !mim and Twitch for
    mentored community learning.

sl: &sl >-
    🐱 I am MoHax in Second Life, a virtual worlds platform that
    took off in 2007. I ran Mo's Mentored, played guitar, managed sims for
    IBM and the SL Ballet. Did triathlon training there. I've built
    combat systems, simulators for fire and rescue, diploma giver,
    MoPose, and EDTECH Retreat. It was a huge part of my life from 2007
    until 2010. I've met thousands. Oh the stories.

fluff: >-
  ⛅ https://github.com/rwxrob/fluff Happy little clouds at home, on
  your desktop, in VirtualBox or VMware.

pegn: >-
  🔥 https://pegn.dev I created the Parsing Expression Grammar Notation
  (PEGN) (inspired by Brian Ford's PEG) for expressing any grammar in
  a way that is easy to parse cognitively and programmatically without
  any specific application or implementation in mind. It builds on the
  best of existing meta and data structure languages such as PEG, ABNF,
  EBNF, and !JSON.

lang: >-
  🌎 I am a native English speaker but went to college for Russian and
  lived in Russia and Ukraine for a few years. I also served a Mormon
  mission to the French West Indies where I learned French and Creole.
  I would really love to learn Mandarin and German and Spanish and
  Portuguese eventually. Also see !coding for coding language.

mission: >-
  🌴 Served Mormon mission to French West Indies (Martinique,
  Guadeloupe, St. Martin). I was made Assistant to the President and
  flew all over (Barbados, etc.) Loved it even though I lost my faith.
  I read shit in church history about black people that made me vomit.
  I never got over it. That was the beginning of the end. Lots of
  stories though, if I'm drunk enough.

rust: >-
  💩 I hate Rust, the syntax is ugly, the mod team resigned in disgust
  over "hypocrisy" of the governance board, PhDs have done
  dissertations on how Rust "safety" is a lie, and nothing substantial
  (like Docker or Kubernetes) has ever been made in Rust. Maybe that's
  why there are virtually no jobs for it. Meanwhile, !go blows Rust away
  for the things which matter most and has tons of projects and !jobs.

python: >-
    💢 Learn Python, because you must these days. It's fucking
    everywhere (not just !ml).  Python is like a bad breakup, an X who
    threw my stuff in the street.  I've witnessed it turn good coders
    into bigots who wouldn't learn anything else. Taught 5 years at
    !skilstak. !Go is a much better language than Python on every single
    level, even !Guido agrees.

guido: >-
    🔥 "I learned a painful lesson, that for small programs dynamic typing is
    great, for large programs you have to have a more disciplined approach
    and it helps if the language actually gives you that discipline, rather
    than telling you 'Well you can do whatever you want'" (Guido, Python !BDFL)

os: &os >-
  💻 I run Ubuntu Server running in VirtualBox on both Windows desktop,
  and Mac laptop. Personally, after running a Linux desktop for more
  than a decade I want nothing to do with Linux desktops. Most people
  cannot run Linux desktops at work, and I want to help *them*. Plus,
  I stream and Streamlabs is essential software and only works on
  Windows or Mac.

learn: >-
  ⚡ Stuff you should learn: 1) think like a !hacker 2) !Linux terminal
  3) !Vim editing with !UNIX !filters 4) !bash scripting 5) !Go
  programming 6) !Markdown and !Pandoc 7) !Git and !GitHub 8) minimal
  !web publishing (!HTML/!CSS/!JS) 9) !Docker !containers 10) text-based
  !search with !lynx 11) !C for understanding 12) !python 13) !perl 14)
  Kubernetes (!k8s)

learning: >-
    ⚡ I'm learning Kubernetes (!k8s) at modern, cloud native
    infrastructure,  both !onprem and !gcp. I hope to get Kubernetes CKAD,
    CKA, CKS by August 1st. I'm also learning all the shit related to
    Kubernetes they don't tell you that you need to learn: Istio, Calico,
    OPA Gatekeeper, Tekton, ElasticSearch, etc. I'm always learning better
    !Go coding techniques as well.

streamlabs: >-
  💡 I fucking love Streamlabs. Just the video clip publisher and
  message highlighter are worth every penny. I don't care that they
  didn't mention OBS and changed their name. It is an *amazing* product
  that has saved me so much time writing my own stuff I can't even
  calculate it.

hacker: &hacker >-
  😎💻 Hacking is a mind-set. Hackers figures shit out, !autodidacts who
  make stuff do what they want in unexpected ways. Hackers learn more
  about than the original creators. That's it. Hackers are, therefore,
  pragmatic scientists. They !RWX their way though life for fun and
  profit. Learn to think like a hacker. You'll be smarter for it. Hack
  the !planet.

hackers: *hacker

planet: >-
    🌎🌏🌍 Hack the planet! It's more than just a call to arms for geeks
    with purpose all over the world, it's a way of life, a commitment to
    making a difference. To being !hackers in the best sense doing what
    it takes to reduce suffering for everyone (and everything) on this
    pretty blue marble. We need everyone's help. No need to join. You're
    already on the team.

pay: &pay >-
    💰💨 Pay it forward. Humans have been doing it forever. It's how we
    progress, always has been. Someone helped you. Now help someone
    yourself. You don't need permission or a formal arrangement or
    a fucking school. Share what you know.  Scarcity mentality is from
    greed and fear, fear leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. There's
    plenty for everyone. Let go. You'll be fine.

payitforward: *pay

irc: >-
  💬 Internet Relay Chat is the first real messaging system that worked
  across the network. It is still very popular with !hackers and is the
  basis for all Twitch chat. That's right. You don't need Twitch. You
  can just use IRC. Look for "Twitch Without the Twitch" on my
  https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/about page.

cowork: &cowork >-
  🤔 Coworking is like going someplace quiet with friends to !focus on
  stuff we have to get done, individually.  Occasionally, we'll take
  a break to chat but no !talking so people can bring their own !music or
  use !irc and not miss anything.

coworking: *cowork

busy: >-
  💢💨 Why am I SO busy? There's a lot wrong with the world and I try to
  follow the creed: don't get mad, get busy. There's a lot to get angry
  about,  you can waste time complaining and arguing, or you can
  actually do something about it. !creed

pandoc: >-
  📃 I write everything with !vim and usually write !markdown in Pandoc
  notation. The automatic formatting and stuff is from my Vim plugin
  that I upgraded to have smart-quotes and such.

unicode: &unicode >-
  📑 Unicode is an information standard for the consistent encoding, of
  text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. It's where
  emojis come from. Unlike "characters" a Unicode code point (rune) can
  be from 7 to 32 bits long. A lot of code dealing with text is really
  broken (reason for Python 3). The !go language was created by two
  co-creators of Unicode.

rune: *unicode

json: >-
  📑 Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a structured data language.
  !Learn it even though YAML is better for configs and Protobuf is
  better for transfer and storage. JSON organizes data consistently in
  a way that humans can read and transfer quickly over the web. MongoDB
  and most REST APIs are based on JSON.

college: &college >-
  💢💤 Don't college. If you must, !wgu or community. Don't pay a lot.
  No one cares. Be a big fish in a small pond. You'll do better.  Jobs
  just want your skills. Don't care how learned. Why college? 1) learn
  skill 2) meet people 3) find yourself 4) use resources 5) learn to do
  your own laundry. College just bundles that stuff for convenience ---
  at a huge fucking price.

university: *college

prof: >-
  👨🏫 Taught at community college. Hated it. People want passing grade.
  Recruited for private schools. Hated it. No mentoring. Offered big
  money to make closed learning content. Nope. Almost became
  a professor. Talked out of it by another one. "Definitely, not you."
  I love helping others learn. Turns out academia prioritizes profit and
  football over learning. !college

ruby: >-
  👎 In 2007 I was obsessed with Ruby, even talked with Matz and made
  a popular INI gem. These days Ruby is the fastest dying language.
  Check TIOBE and others, or just ask around. Most Ruby fans have moved
  to Crystal these days. Ruby will be used for decades, but it is *not*
  a "greenfield" language any longer. Learn !go !python !javascript,
  even Java instead.

specs: >-

  🎧🎤 Yamaha MG10XU, Shure SM7B Mic, Rhode Go II Wireless Mics, Rhode
  NT1A Compressor Mic, Beats Studio Pros (about six pair), Altec
  Lansing, etc. Headphone.  I'm a pretty big audiophile. Ran sound for
  several small gigs.

24: &24 >-
  ⏰ "24 hours, WTF?!" Right? Well, don't be impressed. I'm not always
  here. I leave the stream on so that the community can connect and use
  Twitch like a form of IRC. In fact, many *are* using IRC. Think of it
  as IRC with music and !fishies and some old dude !coding mostly !go and
  !bash on this favorite !distro. I switch to Music category when not
  here.

24hour: *24
24hours: *24

cobra: >-
  💩 The people behind Cobra are amazing, but the !go Cobra commander
  itself is absolute shit, popular shit. Now we are all fucked because
  of being forced to use it. Consider kubectl requires 12637 lines of
  eval-ed shell code just for completion, plus it was made by !getopt
  zombies 🧟. Consider 🌳 !bonzai instead, created to start fresh with
  *good* command line !UX.

getopt: >-
  💩 GetOpt is the shit that forces us to use dashes for everything on
  the command line. It's always been a horrible disaster. For a full
  explanation, read *all* of the following. Then, keep calm, and !go
  !bozai. 🌳😊 https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/tree/main/20220409085345

ux: >-
  😊💻 User experience (UX) is the art of creating amazing interactions
  with those using whatever you create. People go to school just for UX
  design (which is generally associated with graphic user interfaces,
  but not necessarily). !getopt is an example of a fucking terrible
  command-line UX.

monitors: >-
  💻 I have four monitors and a laptop to my left, 24"-ish and 4k. I use
  1080p for streaming. I hate huge monitors, slow as fuck and you cannot
  reconfigure them. Three of the monitors are in a line across the top
  of my main monitor with the top of the main at eye level. Others are
  on my speakers. No fancy, stupid mounting hardware. !terminal !distro
  !specs

findjob: >-
  💪💰 Finding a good job is about one thing: trust. So, 1) find someone
  with a job 2) get them trust you. You find people through friends,
  meetups, alumni, coworkers, communities. Cold calling almost never
  works. As vmttmv said, "skill, or merit, is triumphed by nepotism 9/10
  times." And start filling GitHub profile with proof you know your
  shit, whatever shit that is.

stallman: &stallman >-
  😐 What do I think of Richard (RMS) Stallman? Short answer: I don't.
  He's perhaps the most influential technologist of our time, who else
  can claim they changed business models as well as tech? Linus can't.
  But I disagree with *everything* else about the dude. Emacs is
  a disgusting sin against the !UNIX philosophy. GPLv3 is a immoral
  disaster. FSF is criminal.

rms: *stallman

keg: &keg >-
  🌐 Working on Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG) since 2016, an alternative
  to the Web, decentralized at the core, a graph network of content
  focused on knowledge over advertising written in CommonMark with
  MathJax, no scripts, semantic so anyone can easily create own search
  engine. You "follow" others (like RSS but !zet) for updates and use
  ring of trust so only good content.

kegml: >-
    📓 The markup language for !keg is a very simplified version of
    CommonMark + MathJax that also recognizes KEG node IDs (which is
    just an !isosec that begins with `K`). KEGML is designed to require
    nothing but paper and pencil to create and maintain and is more then
    10 times faster than CommonMark to parse making it ideal for KEG
    where parsing happens often.

xmas: >-
  🎅🎄 Okay, so I look like Santa and have a perpetual Xmas tree with
  lights on it. (Yes, I'm X-ing Christ on purpose, Jesus-freaks can fuck
  right off, pagans had it first.) My dad was paid as
  a motorcycle-riding Santa during the holiday, Nordic roots I guess.
  I love the *spirit* and beauty of the holiday, but I fucking hate
  everything else. Lights just make me happy.

lab: >-
  🧪🥼🤯💥 https://github.com/rwxrob/lab The X in !rwx means to
  experiment, explore, experience, and exchange. You can't do that
  without a lab.  That's right a lab. I'm constantly blowing stuff up in
  there experimenting rather than reading through tons of potentially
  incorrect docs. Have a look at my lab and share yours with others.

curl: >-
  🌐 curl is a program for making web requests from the command line
  !cli and is a critical tool when working with web service interfaces
  (!apis) that allow different things, like posting a twitch chat,
  tweet, or checking bank statements. The data is usually in !JSON
  format. Learning curl is critical thing to learn for any technologist.
  It's even builtin to Chrome DevTools.

kb: &kb >-
  📝 My keyboard is same as the world's greatest writers, journalists,
  and creatives: a 2016 Apple chicklet keyboard (no butterfly keys). I do
  about 108 wpm on a good day.  Coding demands comfort above all. I know
  so many coders who started using mechanical and have been to doctor
  because of it. But hey, you do you (and welcome the carpel tunnel).

keyboard: *kb

offscreen: >-
    🚫💻 When !coworking I'm using another computer or screen a lot.
    Usually, I'll put the !fishies and !music on. I try to leave the
    webcam on anyway, even if !muted during conference calls for !work.

games: >-
    💚 Witcher3, Dota2, Overwatch, ShenzenIO, TF2, Minecraft. Those are
    the only games I play. I usually enjoying !hacking and !coding more
    than playing games.

gamedev: >-
    💢 I've made educational games for !skilstak, but not many others.
    My idea of a good game is one that makes you solve problems and
    think. I wish more game devs made *good* games that didn't smell
    like educational games. The world would be in a much better place.
    I get annoyed at "Software and Game Dev" category when people
    assume I'm coding a game, as if that's all there is.

oidc: >-
    📖 OpenID Connection is an authentication protocol built on !OAuth
    2.0. It makes it easier for users to login to apps, web and
    otherwise. Having OIDC provider support is a core design component
    of most software these days. If you are using GitHub to login to
    another app you are using it. Works from the command-line also.
    Kubernetes (!k8s) usually uses it to login.

oauth: >-
    📖 OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, a way to login
    to stuff. It prevents secrets from being saved in an application (or
    by the provider of the application on their servers that can be
    hacked later). It's a pain in the ass to setup as a dev, but you
    *must* learn it. Thankfully, !oidc has made things somewhat simpler.

k8s: &k8s >-
    📖 What if you could plug thousands of CPUs, GPUs, and RAM sticks
    into your gaming rig or server and divide them up dynamically to do
    different jobs safely. That's !containers in Kubernetes. K8S is like
    a meta operating system for thousands of combined machines doing
    millions of different things, like processes in a single machine,
    but across many. !job

kubernetes: *k8s

reppoints: >-
    🌟 Rep (!rep) just a way to thank you for helping and chatting and
    just hanging out. They will never get you anything. They just are.
    I do take into account when you have a question or comment. It's
    a way to tell people who just get here and ask me to personally
    mentor them to fuck off until they've contributed a little bit to
    the community themselves first.

wsl2: &wsl2 >-
    💩 WSL2 is shit. Use !GitBash and a !VM instead.  I raved about it
    for two full weeks. People took bets on how long "Windows is the
    best desktop Linux" would last. It didn't.  WSL2 1) is too slow,
    even stopped Vim from being useful; 2) fucks up permissions; 3)
    can't mount thumb drives; 4) mixes exes with !Linux commands; 5) and
    is always behind current Linux.

wsl: *wsl2

vm: >-
    💻 A "virtual machine" is a computer (machine) made out of software
    (not hardware). VMs and the basis of all modern "elastic" computing.
    You can run 10 VMs on your !desktop for whatever reason (and there are
    many) or you can run 10s of thousands in your !onprem !cloud. There are
    three main VM providers: !VirtualBox !VMWare !KVM

kvm: >-
    ⛅ KVM is the primary !vm for !Linux but is mostly used by cloud
    providers and not so much on the !desktop. For that people use
    !VirtualBox or !VMWare.

vbox: &vbox >-
    💻⛅ VirtualBox is the leading !VM !desktop application (mostly
    because it's 100% free. It also has the sharpest !CLI and integrates
    well with !dev tools. I use it extensively (!os) and so should you.
    !boost requires it. You *must* know it to be a tech today. !vmware
    is a professional, proprietary alternative. WARNING: Does not
    work on Mac M1 *and never will*.

vmware: >-
    💻⛅ VMWare is the leading *proprietary* !VM !desktop application.
    It costs about $300 but runs on Mac M1 (!vbox does not). They also
    try to sell you their other stuff rather than give you a good !API
    and !CLI. They have a *free* version but it is limited to one VM
    (which is useless).

virtualbox: *vbox

gitbash: &gitbash >-
    💻 https://git-scm.com The best way to get the essential tools (git,
    ssh, and bash) on Windows and have everything just work. Maintained
    by the !git project (not Microsoft). Commands like chmod actually
    does what you expect (unlike !wsl). BTW, you don't need this on Mac
    or Linux.

git-bash: *gitbash
